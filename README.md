# Interactive Map of Health Facilities in Kakamega County

This project creates an **interactive map** of health facilities in Kakamega County using Python and Folium.
Role of the Interactive Map

This interactive map provides a visual representation of health facilities in Kakamega County. Instead of working with raw spreadsheets or static reports, users can explore the location, distribution, and accessibility of hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries on a dynamic map.
Identifying service gaps → Helps policymakers and county planners see which areas have limited or no access to health facilities.

Equitable distribution → Supports fair allocation of resources (staff, equipment, medicine) based on population needs and geographic spread.

Infrastructure planning → Guides decisions on where to build new facilities or upgrade existing ones.

Emergency response → Improves response planning by highlighting facility locations relative to population centers and road networks.

Transparency and accountability → Provides citizens and stakeholders with open access to information about health infrastructure in the county.
## Features
